  <h1> The Police vs. the People. </h1>
</article>
  <p> Violence is reported by the media every day. However, it seems that the worst "type" of violent crime is a bipartisan issue. People who lean towards the left typically focus on police brutality while people who lean towards the right focus on looting and violence against the police. This page focuses on the trends of violent crime and violence against the police in order to understand why the police budgets in many cities continue to increase.</p>

<h2> Analysis </h2>
</article>
<p> The two charts showcase similar trends. Both the amount of police officers assaulted and the amount of violent crime in the U.S. has increased. This, however, does not mean that more funding should be put into police departments to prevent crime. In fact, several cities have increased their police budget's yet overall crime in the U.S. has increased. </p>

<p>Here are some examples of cities who have increased their budget: <br>
